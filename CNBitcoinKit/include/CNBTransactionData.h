 Create transaction data object using a fee rate, calculating fee via number of inputs and outputs. Estimate 100 bytes per input/output, times fee rate. For example, 1 input and 2 outputs would have an estimated size of 300 bytes, times 5 satoshi fee rate, would equal 1500 satoshis for a fee.

 @param paymentAddress The address to which you want to send currency.
 @param unspentTransactionOutputs An array of all available UTXOs, which will be selected by this method.
 @param amount The amount which you would like to send to the receipient.
 @param feeRate The fee rate to be multiplied by the estimated transaction size.
 @param changePath The derivative path for receiving change, if any.
 @param blockHeight The current block height, used to calculate the locktime (blockHeight + 1).
 @return Returns an instantiated object if fully able to satisfy amount+fee with UTXOs, or nil if insufficient funds.
